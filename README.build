This memo explains the rule how to build pgpool-II source tree using
autotools and need to push derived files such as Makefile.in into
pgpool-II official source reporsitory.

So the rule does not apply to:

- users who just run configure and make.
- developers who just change source files (*.[chl])

Developers need to follow following rules if they want to add/remove
source files since it requires to change Makefile.am.

Since pgpool-II uses autotools to create Makefiles, it is very
important to fix the tool chain versions. To ensure this, all
developers who need to use autotools *and* push the changes to the
source repository *must* use following platform:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

More precisely required tool chain versions are following:

autoconf 2.69
automake 1.14.1
libtool 2.4.2

If you could prepare the same tool chain version, maybe you don't need
to use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, but I have not tested yet.

This may be changed in the future but for now, please use it as the
reference platform.

To ensure rebuild does not run, configure.ac has the lines:

dnl Disallow to rebuild configure.
AM_MAINTAINER_MODE(disable)

If you need to rebuild, you can remove this or run configure with
"--enable-maintainer-mode" option.
